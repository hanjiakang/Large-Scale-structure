#prerequisite pakage:healpy, camb
First, I used camb to generate a appropriate power spectrum with the parameters from the camb demo.
Then, I apply fucntion synfast on the power spectrum, which generate a temperature map according to the power spectrum
In the end, I apply function anafast on the map generate from the last step, which calculate the power spectrum from the map.
After ploting the original power spectrum and the power spectrum from the map on the same figure, it turned out that the two lines fitted pretty well.
